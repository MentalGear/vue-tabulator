# Introduction

::: danger
The vue-tabulator is not production ready.
PR are welcome.
:::
The lib [Tabulator](http://tabulator.info/) is great, because is pure JavaScript, but sometimes when using vue-apps we need a better, simple integration, like [reactive data](http://tabulator.info/docs/4.2/release#reactive-data), events, components editors and other things.

How we can be the Great Tabulator better?

Welcome the Vue-Tabulator.
